# IST311MathQuiz
IST 311 Group Project


This project is designed to teach children grade school arithmetic. It implements three quiz levels and one bonus level. Each question is randomly generated and worth 100 points if answered correctly. If a user gets at least 400 points for a level, the user gets to advance to the next level. The first bonus level is accessed after a user completes the second level.
