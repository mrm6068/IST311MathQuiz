# IST311MathQuiz
IST 311 Group Project

## General Description
This project is designed to teach children grade school arithmetic. It implements three quiz levels and two bonus levels. Each question is randomly generated and worth 100 points if answered correctly. If a user gets at least 400 points for a level, the user gets to advance to the next level. The first bonus level is accessed after a user completes the second level and the second is accessed after the fourth level. Bonus questions are worth 150 points if answered correctly. Unlike the other four levels, it does not instantiate the problems. It has it's own set of problems in it's class.
